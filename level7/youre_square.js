A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples
isSquare(-1) // => false
isSquare( 3) // => false
isSquare( 4) // => true
isSquare(25) // => true
isSquare(26) // => false

*/


var isSquare = function(n){
  if (n < 0){
    return false;
  }

  var m = Math.sqrt(n);
  
  return (m - parseInt(m) == 0);

}

// Test
Test.describe("isSquare", function(){
  Test.it("should work for some examples", function(){
    Test.expect(!isSquare(-1), "Negative numbers cannot be square numbers");
    Test.expect(!isSquare( 3));
    Test.expect( isSquare( 4));
    Test.expect( isSquare(25));
    Test.expect(!isSquare(26));
  });
  Test.it("should work for random square numbers", function(){
    var r, i;
    for(i = 0; i < 100; ++i){
      r = (Math.random() * 0xfff0) | 0;
      Test.expect(isSquare(r*r), (r * r) + " is a square number");
    }
  });
});
